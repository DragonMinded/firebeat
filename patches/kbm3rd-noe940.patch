# If you have used a donor board from a Pop'n Music or Beatmania III to do a
# mainboard repair for Keyboard Mania, sometimes it can throw an E940 error
# after passing all hardware checks. This seems to be an error verifying that
# the software is running on the right type of Firebeat. This skips this check
# and allows you to transplant parts between Firebeat boards to make a Keyboard
# Mania main board.
